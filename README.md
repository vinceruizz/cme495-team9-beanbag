# CME 495 Team 9 - Automated Bean Bag Toss Scoring System

## An automated scoring system for a 9-hole variant of the bean bag toss game.

This project is being developed for a 4th year capstone project at the University of Saskatchewan College of Engineering. Our vision is to create an automated scoring system for a 9-hole 
variant of the bean bag toss game (see Game Rules). Special thanks to our supervisor Rory Gowen for designing the physical game board and for his guidance on the creation of the system.
